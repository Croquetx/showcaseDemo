This code snippet defines a full Croquet Metaverse Web Showcase in an HTML application. The Showcase platform was created with Croquet Microverse - the first true multiuser Metaverse OS. Showcase includes incredible
Dolby&reg spatial voice chat, display of your images including links to other pages, scrollable documents, and even shared videos. 

Once your customers load this directly from your web server into their browser, your business will 
immediately join the multiuser Metaverse. We suggest however, that you embed it in your current
home page as an iFrame - just as we do at http://croquet.io. 

You control what images, PDF documents and videos are in this world by modifying this code snippet. 

To embed the Metaverse Web Showcase into your website:

1. Click the “Copy to Clipboard” button that’s under the code and save it into a new file or press the "Download" button to create a new "showcase.html" file. This file will run immediately and will display
the current assets available from Croquet.
2. Replace any of these default media assets with links to your own.
3. You can run this showcase directly from your web site or embed it into an iFrame in your web page.
